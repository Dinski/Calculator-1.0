Write unit tests for the calculator jar  library (Calculator-1.0.jar)

Write tests using any testing framework (JUnit or TestNG);
Each class should test only one method of the library;
Tests pre-conditions and post-conditions should be implemented with appropriate annotations;
Run tests in IDE;

Create parametrized tests (data-driven approach);
Configure and execute tests in parallel mode.
